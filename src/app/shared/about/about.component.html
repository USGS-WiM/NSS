                        The National Streamflow Statistics (NSS) program provides the U.S. Geological Survey developed and published regression equations, 
                        such as mean annual and monthly mean flows, flow-duration percentiles, and peak and low flows for or every State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
                        and several metropolitan areas in the United States. The NSS program is used for a variety of water-resource purposes, such as bridge and culvert 
                        design, and emergency planning and management such as drought and flood zone identification and total maximum daily load estimates in ungaged locations.
