                            The National Streamflow Statistics (NSS) program provides the U.S. Geological Survey developed and published regression equations, 
                            such as mean annual and monthly mean flows, flow-duration percentiles, and peak and low flows for or every State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
                            and several metropolitan areas in the United States. The NSS program is used for a variety of water-resource purposes, such as bridge and culvert 
                            design, and emergency planning and management such as drought and flood zone identification and total maximum daily load estimates in ungaged locations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Much of the functionality in the NSS program is also available in the <a href="https://streamstats.usgs.gov"
                            target="_blank">StreamStats</a> application. StreamStats provides a map-based user interface that allows selection of 
                            interest and automates the process of computing basin characteristics and estimating flow statistics for ungaged sites. 
                            StreamStats also provide access to previously computed information for gaged sites. As a result, StreamStats normally 
                            should be used in areas where it is available. However, NSS has the additional capabilities of providing: (1) peak-flow 
                            frequency plots, (2) peak-flow hydrograph plots, (3) maximum flood estimates based on envelope curves developed by Crippen 
                            and Bue (1977), (4) peak-flow estimates for gaged sites determined by weighting estimates from the systematic record with 
                            those from the relevant regression equations, and (5) peak-flow estimates for ungaged sites that are determined by weighting
                            regression-based estimates for the sites with weighted estimates for a nearby gaged site.
